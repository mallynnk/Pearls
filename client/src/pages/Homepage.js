            The farm is located just outside of Beaufort, a small town in
            eastern North Carolina. The North Riverâ€™s nutrient rich water flows
            through our oysters, giving them a great sense of place when you try
            one. Shackleford Banks and Cape Lookout are all the stands between
            the farm and the Atlantic Ocean.

            Our flagship oysters, Beaufort Brinys, are available for purchase
            directly from the Royster himself as well as a few restaurants
            located in Beaufort and Raleigh.{" "}

                        The farm is located just outside of Beaufort, a small town in
                        eastern North Carolina. The North Riverâ€™s nutrient rich water flows
                        through our oysters, giving them a great sense of place when you try
                        one. Shackleford Banks and Cape Lookout are all the stands between
                        the farm and the Atlantic Ocean.

            Our flagship oysters, Beaufort Brinys, are available for purchase
            directly from the Royster himself as well as a few restaurants
            located in Beaufort and Raleigh.{" "}

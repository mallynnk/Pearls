## Description
Roysters Nc is a small family owned and operated business that provides customers with ethically harvested farm to table oysters for purchase. Our team has created a react application for this business that serves as both a marketing tool for Royster‚Äôs and a purchasing platform for customers. Users who visit our site will be able to do more than just purchase oysters, though. We‚Äôve included educational info about oysters, detailed local
weather on the farm, a library of photographs and more to give the user a sense of place when interacting with our site.

We would like to integrate Royster's instagram feed into the site & add a mailing list functionality.
